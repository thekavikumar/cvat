    <div class="lead">Guidelines for assessing annotation quality in CVAT automatically</div>
	<p>In CVAT, it&rsquo;s possible to evaluate the quality of annotation through the creation
of a validation subset of images. To estimate the task quality, CVAT compares
all other jobs in the task against the established <strong>Ground truth</strong> job,
and calculates annotation quality based on this comparison.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that quality estimation only supports
2d tasks. It supports all the annotation types except 2d cuboids.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that quality estimation is currently available for tasks and jobs.
Quality estimation in projects is not supported.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>CVAT has the following features for automated quality control of annotations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Validation set configuration for a task</li>
<li>Job validation on job finish (&ldquo;<a href="../../../../../docs/enterprise/immediate-feedback/">Immediate feedback</a>&rdquo;)</li>
<li>Review mode for problems found</li>
<li>Quality analytics</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>There are several approaches to quality estimation used in the industry. In CVAT,
we can use a method known as Ground Truth or Honeypots. The method assumes there are
Ground Truth annotations for images in the dataset. This method is statistical,
which means that we can use only a small portion of the whole dataset to
estimate quality on the full dataset, so we don&rsquo;t need to annotate the whole dataset twice.
Here we assume that the images in the dataset are similar (represent the same task).</p>
<p>We will call the validation portion of the whole dataset (or a task in CVAT) a validation set.
In practice, it is typically expected that annotations in the validation set are carefully
validated and curated. It means that they are more expensive - creating them might require
expert annotators or just several iterations of annotation and validation. It means that it&rsquo;s
desirable to keep the validation set small enough. At the same time, it must be representative
enough to provide reliable estimations. To achieve this, it&rsquo;s advised that the validation set
images are sampled randomly and independently from the full dataset.
That is, for the quality assurance to function correctly, the validation set must
have some portion of the task frames, and the frames must be chosen randomly.</p>
<p>Depending on the dataset size, data variance, and task complexity,
<strong>5-15% of the data is typically good enough</strong> for quality estimation,
while keeping extra annotation overhead for the Ground Truth acceptable.</p>
<p>For example, in a typical <strong>task with 2000 frames</strong>, selecting <strong>just 5%</strong>,
which is 100 extra frames to annotate, <strong>is enough</strong> to estimate the
annotation quality. If the task contains <strong>only 30 frames</strong>, it&rsquo;s advisable to
select <strong>8-10 frames</strong>, which is <strong>about 30%</strong>. It is more than 15%,
but in the case of smaller datasets, we need more samples to estimate quality reliably,
as data variance is higher.</p>
<h2 id="ground-truth-jobs">Ground truth jobs</h2>
<p>A <strong>Ground Truth job</strong> (GT job) is a way to represent the validation set in a CVAT task.
This job is similar to regular annotation jobs - you can edit the annotations manually,
use auto-annotation features, and import annotations in this job. There can be no more
than 1 Ground Truth job in a task.</p>
<p>To enable quality estimation in a task, you need to create a Ground truth job in the task,
annotate it, switch the job stage to <code>acceptance</code>, and set the job state to <code>completed</code>.
Once the Ground Truth job is configured, CVAT will start using this job for quality estimation.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>A <em>configured</em> Ground Truth job is required for all quality computations in CVAT.</p>
<h2 id="validation-modes">Validation modes</h2>
<p>Currently, there are 2 validation modes available for tasks: <strong>Ground Truth</strong> and <strong>Honeypots</strong>.
These names are often used interchangeably, but in CVAT they have some differences.
Both modes rely on the use of Ground Truth annotations in a task,
stored in a <a href="#ground-truth-jobs">Ground Truth job</a>, where they can be managed.</p>
<h3 id="ground-truth">Ground Truth</h3>
<p>In this mode some of the task frames are selected into the validation set, represented as a
separate Ground Truth job. The regular annotation jobs in the task are not affected in any way.</p>
<p>Ground Truth jobs can be created at the task creation automatically or
manually at any moment later. They can also be removed manually at any moment.
This validation mode is available for any tasks and annotations.</p>
<p>This is a flexible mode that can be enabled or disabled at any moment without any disruptions
to the annotation process.</p>
<h4 id="frame-selection">Frame selection</h4>
<p>This validation mode can use several frame selection methods.</p>
<h5 id="random">Random</h5>
<p>This is a simple method that selects frames into the validation set randomly,
representing the <a href="#basics">basic approach</a>, described above.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>frame count - the number or percent of the task frames to be used for validation.
Can be specified as an absolute number in the <code>Frame count</code> field or a percent in the <code>Quantity</code>
field. If there are both fields on the page, they are linked, which means changing one of them
will adjust the other one automatically.</li>
<li>random seed - a number to be used to initialize the random number generator. Can be useful if
you want to create a reproducible sequence of frames.</li>
</ul>
<h5 id="random-per-job">Random per job</h5>
<p>This method selects frames into the validation set randomly from each annotation job in the task.</p>
<p>It solves one of the issues with the simple Random method that some of the jobs can get
no validation frames, which makes it impossible to estimate quality in such jobs. Note
that using this method can result in increased total size of the validation set.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>frame count per job - the percent of the job frames to be used for validation.
This method uses segment size of the task to select the same number of validation frames
in each job, if possible. Can be specified as an absolute number in the <code>Frame count</code>
field or a percent in the <code>Quantity per job</code> field. If there are both fields on the page,
they are linked, which means changing one of them will adjust the other one automatically.</li>
<li>random seed - a number to be used to initialize the random number generator. Can be useful if
you want to create a reproducible sequence of frames.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="honeypots">Honeypots</h3>
<p>In this mode some random frames of the task are selected into the validation set.
Then, validation frames are randomly mixed into regular annotation jobs.
This mode can also be called &ldquo;Ground Truth pool&rdquo;, reflecting the way validation frames are used.
This mode can only be used at task creation and cannot be changed later.</p>
<p>The mode has some limitations on the compatible tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>It&rsquo;s not possible to use it for an already existing task, the task has to be recreated.</li>
<li>This mode assumes random frame ordering, so it is only available for image annotation tasks
and not for ordered sequences like videos.</li>
<li>Tracks are not supported in such tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>The validation set can be managed after the task is created - annotations can be edited,
frames can be excluded and restored, and honeypot frames in the regular jobs can be changed.
However, it&rsquo;s not possible to select new validation frames after the task is created.
The Ground truth job created for this validation mode cannot be deleted.</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>frame count per job (%) - the percent of job frames (segment size) to be <strong>added</strong> into each
annotation job from the validation set. Can be specified in the <code>Overhead per job</code> field.</li>
<li>total frame count (%) - the percent of the task frames to be included into the validation set.
This value must result in at least <code>frame count per job</code> * <code>segment size</code> frames. Can be specified
in the <code>Total honeypots</code> field.</li>
</ul>

</table>
<h3 id="choosing-the-right-mode">Choosing the right mode</h3>
<p>Here are some examples on how to choose between these options. The general advice is to use
Ground Truth for better flexibility, but keep in mind that it can require more resources for
validation set annotation. Honeypots, on the other hand, can be beneficial if you want to
minimize the number of validation images required, but the downside here is that there are some
limitations on where this mode can be used.</p>
<p>Example: a video annotation with tracks. In this case there is only 1 option -
the Ground Truth mode, so just use it.</p>
<p>Example: an image dataset annotation, image order is not important. Here you can use both options.
You can choose Ground Truth for better flexibility in validation. This way, you will have the
full control of validation frames in the task, annotation options won&rsquo;t be limited, and the
regular jobs will not be affected in any way. However, if you have a limited budget
for the validation (for instance, you have only a small number of validation frames) or you want
to allow more scalability (with this approach the number of validation frames doesn&rsquo;t depend on
the number of regular annotation jobs), it makes sense to consider using Honeypots instead.</p>
<h2 id="quality-management">Quality management</h2>
<p>If a task has a validation configured, there are several options to manage validation set images.
With any of the validation modes, there will be a special Ground Truth (GT) job in the task.</p>
<h3 id="validation-set-management">Validation set management</h3>
<p>Validation frames can be managed on the task Quality Management page. Here it&rsquo;s possible to
check the number of validation frames, current validation mode and review the frame details.
For each frame you can see the number of uses in the task. When in the Ground Truth mode, this
number will be 1 for all frames. With Honeypots, these numbers can be 0, 1 or more.</p>
<h4 id="frame-changes">Frame changes</h4>
<p>In both validation modes it&rsquo;s possible to exclude some of the validation frames
from being used for validation. This can be useful if you find that some
of the validation frames are &ldquo;bad&rdquo;, extra, or if they have incorrect annotations,
which you don&rsquo;t want to fix. Once a frame is marked &ldquo;excluded&rdquo;, it will not be used
for validation. There is also an option to restore a previously excluded frame if you decide so.</p>
<p>There is an option to exclude or restore frames in bulk mode. To use it, select the frames needed
using checkboxes, and click one of the buttons next to the table header.</p>
<h4 id="ground-truth-job-management">Ground Truth job management</h4>
<p>In the Ground Truth validation mode, there will be an option to remove the <a href="#ground-truth-jobs">Ground Truth job</a>
from the task. It can be useful if you want to change validation set frames completely,
add more frames, or remove some of the frames for any reason. This is available in the job
Actions menu.</p>
<p>In the Honeypots mode, it&rsquo;s not possible to add or remove the GT job, so it&rsquo;s not possible to
add more validation frames.</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../images/honeypot04.jpg" alt="Ground truth job actions"></p>
<h3 id="create">Create</h3>
<p>A Ground Truth job can be <a href="#configuring-quality-estimation">added manually</a>
in a task without a selected validation mode or in a task with the Ground Truth validation mode,
after the existing Ground Truth job is <a href="#delete">deleted manually</a>.</p>
<h3 id="delete">Delete</h3>
<p>To delete the Ground Truth job, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the task and find the Ground Truth job in the jobs list.</li>
<li>Click on three dots to open the menu.</li>
<li>From the menu, select <strong>Delete</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: The Ground truth job in the &ldquo;Honeypots&rdquo; task validation mode cannot be deleted.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="import-annotations">Import annotations</h3>
<p>If you want to import annotations into the Ground truth job, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the task and find the Ground truth job in the jobs list.</li>
<li>Click on three dots to open the menu.</li>
<li>From the menu, select <strong>Import annotations</strong>.</li>
<li>Select import format and select file.</li>
<li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note</strong> that if there are imported annotations for the frames that exist in the task,
but are not included in the <strong>Ground truth</strong> job, they will be ignored.
This way, you don&rsquo;t need to worry about &ldquo;cleaning up&rdquo; your Ground truth
annotations for the whole dataset before importing them.
Importing annotations for the frames that are not known in the task still raises errors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="export-annotations">Export annotations</h3>
<p>To export annotations from the Ground Truth job, do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the task and find a job in the jobs list.</li>
<li>Click on three dots to open the menu.</li>
<li>From the menu, select <strong>Export annotations</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="annotation-management">Annotation management</h3>
<p>Annotations for validation frames can be displayed and edited in a special
<a href="#ground-truth-jobs">Ground Truth job</a> in the task. You can edit the annotations manually,
use auto-annotation features, import and export annotations in this job.</p>
<p>In the Ground Truth task validation mode, annotations of the ground Truth job do not affect
other jobs in any way. The Ground Truth job is just a separate job, which can only be
changed directly. Annotations from <strong>Ground truth</strong> jobs are not included in the dataset
export, they also cannot be imported during task annotations import
or with automatic annotation for the task.</p>
<p>In the Honeypots task validation mode, the annotations of the GT job also do not affect other
jobs in any way. However, import and export of <strong>task</strong> annotations works differently.
When importing <strong>task</strong> annotations, annotations for validation frames will be copied
both into GT job frames and into corresponding honeypot frames in annotation jobs.
When exporting <strong>task</strong> annotations, honeypot frames in annotation jobs will be ignored,
and validation frames in the resulting dataset will get annotations from the GT job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that it means that exporting from a task with honeypots and importing the results back
will result in changed annotations on the honeypot frames. If you want to backup annotations,
use a task backup or export job annotations instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Import and export of Ground Truth <strong>job</strong> annotations works the same way in both modes.</p>
<p>Ground Truth jobs are included in task backups, so can be saved and restored this way.</p>
<p>Import, Export, and Delete options are available from the Ground Truth job Actions menu.

<h2 id="comparisons">Comparisons</h2>
<h3 id="tags">Tags</h3>
<p>The equality is used for matching.</p>
<h3 id="shapes">Shapes</h3>
<p>A pair of shapes is considered matching, if both their shapes and labels match.
For each shape, spatial parameters are matched first, then labels are matched.</p>
<p>Each shape type can have their own spatial matching details. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>bounding box - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index">IoU</a> (including rotation).
For example, for a pair of bounding boxes it can be visualized this way:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../images/quality_comparison_bbox1.svg" alt="Bbox IoU"></p>
<p></br><code>IoU = intersection area / union area</code>.</br>
The green part is the intersection, and green, yellow and red ones together are the union.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>polygons, masks - IoU. Polygons and masks are considered interchangeable,
which means a mask can be matched with a polygon and vice versa. Polygons and masks in groups
are merged into a single object first.
If the <a href="#annotation-quality-settings"><em>Match only visible parts</em></a> option is enabled,
objects will be cut to only the visible (non-covered) parts only, which is determined by the
shape z order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>skeletons - The OKS metric <a href="https://cocodataset.org/#keypoints-eval">from the COCO</a>
dataset is used. Briefly, each skeleton point gets a circular area around,
determined by the <em>object size</em> (bounding box side) and <em>relative point size</em> (<em>sigma</em>) values,
where this point can be matched with the specified probability. If a bounding box is grouped
with the skeleton, it is used for object size computation, otherwise a bounding box of
visible points of the skeleton is used.</p>
<p>For example, consider a skeleton with 6 points and a square bounding box attached:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../images/quality_comparison_skeleton1.svg" alt="Skeleton OKS"></p>
<p>In this example, the <em>Sigma</em> parameter is <code>0.05</code> (5%) of the bbox side.
Areas shown in the green color cover ~68.2% (1 sigma) of the points,
corresponding to each GT point. A point on the boundary of such an area will have ~88% of
probability to be correct. The blue-colored zone contains ~95% (2 sigma) of the correct points
for the corresponding GT point. A point on the boundary of such an area will have ~60% of
probability to be correct. These probabilities are then averaged over the visible points of the
skeleton, and the resulting values are compared against the <em>Min similarity threshold</em>
to determine whether the skeletons are matching. <em>Sigma</em> corresponds to one
from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal distribution</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>points - The OKS metric is used for each point group annotation. Same as for skeletons,
<em>OKS Sigma</em> determines relative point sizes. The <em>Point size base</em> setting allows
configuring whether points in point groups should use the group bounding box or the image space.
Using image space for object size can be useful if you want to treat each point
as a separate annotation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>polylines - A pair of lines is considered matching if all the points of one line lie within
a &ldquo;hull&rdquo; of the other one. The &ldquo;hull&rdquo; is determined as the area around the polyline, such as
if the line had some &ldquo;thickness&rdquo;. For example, the black polyline can have a hull shown in
the green color:</p>
<p><img src="../../../../../images/quality_comparison_polylines1.png" alt="Polyline thickness and hull"></p>
<p>The line thickness can be configured via the <em>Relative thickness</em> setting.
The value is relative to the image side and determines a half of the hull width.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ellipses - IoU, described in more detail above.</p>
</li>
</ul>
